      <p> Thank you for stopping by my website! My name is Bryan and I am a graduate from UHCL with a degree in Healthcare Administration. 
        You must be asking, <i>Why is this guy interested in code?!</i> and you have a valid reason to think so. I started my career working throught the 
        hospital systems local to Houston and eventually transitioned to working at a small start up. It was here that I began being exposed to the world of code 
        as the in-house programmer would consult with the CEO and myself on how to implement major changes to the company's website.

    <h2> Why join a bootcamp? </h2>
      <p> After working at the small start up, I began loving the idea of being able to manipulate, create, and solve problems 
        all with my imagination <i>and using the keyboard ofcourse</i>. I looked thoughout the web and landed on Course Report - a free resource 
        to help prospective students learn more and ultimately join a bootcamp. I looked through countless schools, ie <i>(Flatiron, UT Austin, etc)</i> and realized 
        that digitalcrafts was the right school for me. Each school has its pros/cons, but I had tangible evidence that this school would be right for me.
