      <p> Thank you for stopping by my website! My name is Bryan and I am a graduate from UHCL with a degree in Healthcare Administration. 
        You must be asking, <i>Why is this guy interested in code?!</i>and you have a valid reason to think so. I started my career working throught the 
        hospital systems local to Houston and eventually transitioned to working at a small start up. It was here that I began being exposed to the world of code 
        as the in-house programmer would consult with the CEO and myself on how to implement major changes to the company's website.
